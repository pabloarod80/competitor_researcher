3. **Threat Assessment**: Assigns threat levels (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
4. **Opportunity Identification**: Finds market opportunities from competitor weaknesses
5. **Strategic Recommendations**: Generates specific, actionable recommendations
6. **Action Items**: Creates prioritized action items with departments and timeframes

### What You Get

### Example Analysis Output

```
üî¥ HIGH THREAT LEVEL - Priority monitoring needed

Threat Level: HIGH
Opportunity Level: MEDIUM
Overall Impact: SIGNIFICANT

Executive Summary:
Competitor X announced $50M Series B funding and launched 3 new enterprise features.
High threat due to increased resources and product acceleration. However, negative
customer sentiment presents an opportunity.

Key Findings:
‚Ä¢ Secured $50M Series B from top-tier investors
‚Ä¢ Launched AI-powered analytics feature directly competing with our core offering
‚Ä¢ Customer reviews show frustration with implementation complexity

Threats:
‚Ä¢ New funding enables aggressive sales and marketing expansion
‚Ä¢ AI analytics feature matches 80% of our functionality at lower price point

Opportunities:
‚Ä¢ Poor implementation experience creating customer churn
‚Ä¢ No white-glove onboarding service (our differentiator)

Strategic Recommendations:
1. Accelerate AI feature development to maintain technical lead
2. Double down on customer success and implementation support
3. Launch competitive positioning campaign highlighting ease of implementation

Action Items:
Priority  | Action                                    | Department  | Timeframe
----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|------------
HIGH      | Review and enhance AI feature roadmap     | Product     | This week
HIGH      | Competitive battle card for sales team    | Marketing   | This week
MEDIUM    | Customer success expansion plan           | Operations  | This month
```

### Using Business Insights in the Web UI

1. Navigate to **üí° Business Insights**
2. Choose analysis type:
   - **Individual Competitor**: Deep dive on one competitor
   - **Executive Briefing**: Overview of all competitors
3. Optionally add your business context for tailored insights
4. Click "Analyze Business Impact"
5. Review results: threats, opportunities, recommendations, action items
6. Download analysis as JSON for sharing

### Enabling AI for Enhanced Analysis

The Business Impact Analysis works in two modes:

**With AI (Recommended):**
- More sophisticated analysis
- Context-aware recommendations
- Natural language insights
- Customized to your business context

**Without AI (Rule-Based):**
- Still functional and useful
- Keyword-based threat detection
- Pattern-based opportunity identification
- Generic but actionable recommendations

To enable AI:
1. Go to **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**
2. Enable AI Analysis
3. Choose provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local)
4. Add API key
5. Save settings
